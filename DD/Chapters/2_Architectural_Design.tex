\section{Selected Architectural Styles and Patterns}
\label{sec:sel_arch_styles_patterns}%

The architectural design of the S\&C system leverages a 4-tier architecture, combining well-established architectural styles and design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration.

The system separates concerns across distinct layers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        \textbf{Presentation Layer:} Provides the user interface through a web application. This layer focuses on user interaction and performs basic checks, such as form validation, delegating all business logic to the application server.
    \item 
        \textbf{Web Layer:} Acts as an intermediary, forwarding requests between the presentation layer and the application server while ensuring secure communication.
    \item 
        \textbf{Application Layer:} Implements all the business logic of the system. This layer consists of modular components, each responsible for specific functionalities.
    \item 
        \textbf{Data Layer:} Manages the storage and retrieval of data, ensuring consistency and persistence.
\end{itemize}

The separation of these layers ensures that the system is modular and can be scaled or modified without significant changes to other tiers. The separation between the Web Server and the Application Server was primarily motivated by the enhanced security this approach typically provides. Additionally, this decision positively impacts the system's development process by enabling parallel work across different tiers, allowing multiple teams to collaborate efficiently and expedite implementation.

\subsection{Model-View-Controller (MVC)}
\label{subsec:mvc}%

The \textbf{MVC pattern} is applied to the presentation and application server layers, enabling a clear separation between the user interface (View), user interactions (Controller), and business logic (Model). This structure simplifies the management of the web application’s user interface, allowing the frontend and backend to be developed independently. By isolating business logic from the presentation layer, the pattern ensures that updates to the user interface can be made without impacting the underlying logic, promoting maintainability and scalability.

\subsection{Centralized Access}
\label{subsec:centralized_access}%

The Main Controller simplifies interactions by acting as a \textbf{facade} between the Web Server and backend components. This centralization reduces complexity, ensuring that the Web Server interacts with a unified interface rather than managing connections to multiple components. By consolidating these interactions, the system achieves greater modularity and ease of maintenance. Additionally, the Main Controller enables the implementation of shared logic, such as authentication, validation and error handling, in a single location. This approach avoids duplication across components and ensures consistency in enforcing security policies and logging activities. 

This design also enhances scalability and debugging. With all requests passing through the Main Controller, load management can be centralized, and system behavior can be easily monitored. This approach reduces coupling between tiers, supporting the system's ability to adapt to future changes or expansions.

\subsection{Observer Pattern}
\label{subsec:observer_pattern}%

The \textbf{Notification Manager} leverages this pattern by subscribing to specific events, such as registration completion or new internship postings, and triggering notifications in response. By decoupling event handling from the core logic of other components, this approach ensures that components remain loosely coupled, reducing dependencies on the notification system. This design enhances modularity and extensibility, allowing new event types or notification methods to be added without impacting the rest of the system.

\subsection{Repository Pattern}
\label{subsec:repository_pattern}%

The \textbf{repository pattern} is used to abstract database operations, enabling the application server to interact with data through well-defined, high-level interfaces. This abstraction ensures consistency in how data is accessed and manipulated, while also reducing redundancy in database queries. By centralizing database interactions, this pattern improves maintainability, providing a single source of truth and making it easier to adapt to changes in the underlying data structures or queries.

\newpage

\section{Other design decisions}
\label{sec:other_design_dec}%

Beyond the core architectural styles and patterns, several additional design decisions were made to address specific challenges and enhance system functionality:

\subsection{Event-Driven Asynchronous Processing}

To maintain responsiveness and scalability, \textbf{asynchronous processing} was adopted for tasks like sending notifications. This ensures that user interactions remain smooth and uninterrupted, while heavy operations are handled independently.

\subsection{Security Enhancements}

The system enforces \textbf{HTTPS} for all communication between tiers to safeguard data in transit. Additionally, encryption is applied to sensitive data stored in the database, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts user permissions based on their roles (e.g., student, company, or administrator).

\subsection{Database Query Optimization}

Frequent \textbf{queries}, such as internship searches or user profile retrievals, were optimized through indexing and caching mechanisms. These optimizations ensure high performance, particularly as the system scales to accommodate more users.

\subsection{Integration Flexibility}

\textbf{External integrations}, such as AI tools for CV enhancement and analytics for recommendations, were designed to be \textbf{modular}. This allows new services to be incorporated with minimal changes to the system, supporting adaptability to future requirements.

\subsection{Error Logging and Monitoring}

A unified \textbf{error-handling} and \textbf{logging framework} was implemented across all tiers. This approach facilitates debugging and ensures system administrators can monitor performance and address issues promptly.
