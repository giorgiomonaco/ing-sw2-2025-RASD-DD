This chapter presents the user interfaces of our application, showcasing key designs related to meaningful use cases. Each interface is tailored to specific functionalities and workflows, reflecting how users interact with the system to accomplish their goals. By illustrating these interfaces, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the application's usability, layout, and design principles.

In the RASD, interfaces for login and the main pages of the application were introduced. In this document, we extend this by presenting additional interfaces associated with other important use cases, further demonstrating how the system supports user needs in a seamless and intuitive manner.

\section{Sign Up [UC1]}
\label{sec:UI1_sign_up}%

The first interface is tailored for students, requiring inputs for email, password, first name, last name, and username. The "Accept \& Join" button finalizes the sign-up.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/Signin_Student.png}
    \caption{Sign Up Student.}
    \label{fig:signup_stud_ui}
\end{figure}

The second interface allows company representatives to create accounts by filling out fields for email, password, name, VAT name, and username. The "Accept \& Join" button completes the registration process.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/Signin_Company.png}
    \caption{Sign Up Company.}
    \label{fig:signup_comp_ui}
\end{figure}

A toggle at the top lets users easily switch between the Student and Company sign-up forms.

\section{Insert an enhanced Internship Insertion [UC3]}
\label{sec:UI2_enhanced_intern}%


\textbf{\autoref{fig:post_intern_ui}:} Initial Postage

The first phase represents the initial "Post a New Internship Insertion" form. This interface is displayed when the user clicks the "Post" button on the homepage. The form contains fields for the internship's position name, location, duration, start date, and description, allowing the user to provide all necessary details.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/Postpage.png}
    \caption{Post a New Internship.}
    \label{fig:post_intern_ui}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\autoref{fig:post_intern_fill_ui}:} Filled Form

In the second phase, the form is shown with all fields filled in by the user. The system is now ready to process or enhance the insertion based on the provided information.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/Postpage_filledForm.png}
    \caption{Post a New Internship (filled).}
    \label{fig:post_intern_fill_ui}
\end{figure}


\textbf{\autoref{fig:post_intern_enhance_ui}:} Enhanced Suggestions

The final phase is displayed after the user clicks the "Enhance" button. The system processes the input data and provides suggestions on the right panel to improve the internship insertion. These suggestions may add more specific details to the description to make the posting more appealing and clear.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/Postpage_filledForm_enhance.png}
    \caption{Suggestions on the Internship Post.}
    \label{fig:post_intern_enhance_ui}
\end{figure}



\section{Enhance CV [UC4]}
\label{sec:UI3_enhanced_CV}%

\textbf{\autoref{fig:myprofile_page_ui}:} Viewing the Profile

The first figure represents the profile page of a student within the application. This page displays the student's personal information, such as:

Name, Date of Birth, City, University, Mobile Number, Email and Password, and a section for the uploaded CV file.
The student has the option to upload or enhance his CV using the respective buttons.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/MyProfile.png}
    \caption{MyProfile page.}
    \label{fig:myprofile_page_ui}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\autoref{fig:myprofile_page_enhance_ui}:} Enhancing the CV

The second figure is the result of clicking the Enhance button. The system processes the uploaded CV and provides tailored suggestions in the "Suggestions" section to improve the CV. Examples include adding specific skills, quantifying achievements, or including relevant certifications.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{DD/Images/UI/MyProfile_enhanceCV.png}
    \caption{MyProfile page (enhance).}
    \label{fig:myprofile_page_enhance_ui}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Modifying the CV}

If the student decides to act on the suggestions, they need to modify the CV file externally using their preferred editing tools. Once updated, the student can re-upload the revised CV using the Upload button on the same profile page.

This flow ensures the CV remains user-controlled while benefiting from AI-driven enhancement suggestions provided by the system.
