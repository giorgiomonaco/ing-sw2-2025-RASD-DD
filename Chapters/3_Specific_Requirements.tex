This section is devoted to a specific description of every kind of requirement the system has to deal with in order to achieve all the functionalities described.


\section{ External Interface Requirement}
\label{sec:external_interface_requirements}%


\subsection{User interfaces}
\label{subsec:User_interfaces}%


The S\&C's user interface will be a website, developed in order to be used by all the possible users (Universities, Students and Companies).
The following images provide a high-level overview of the interfaces, offering a glimpse into their structure and functionality. A detailed analysis of these interfaces will be presented in the Design Document.

\newpage

\paragraph{Access Page:} When a user navigates to the website for the first time, the access page serves as the initial interface. Here, users are prompted to log in using their credentials. If the user does not already have an account, they are provided with an option to register and create a new one. Additionally, universities can also access this page to proceed with their specific login or registration process, ensuring seamless on-boarding for both individual users and institutional entities.

        \caption{Access Page UI.}
        \label{fig:access_page_UI}%
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\paragraph{Student Homepage:} When a student enters the homepage, they are greeted with an organized layout. On the left side, an overview of their profile is displayed, along with a section highlighting past and upcoming events. On the right side, a toolbar is provided for searching companies, complemented by an overview of recommended companies. At the top of the page, a small toolbar houses icons for easy access to the homepage, chat, notifications, help, settings, and the student’s personal profile.

        \label{fig:student_homepage_UI}%
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\paragraph{Chat page:} When a user navigates to the chat page, they are presented with a clear layout. On the left side, a list of open chats is displayed, allowing quick access to previous conversations. On the center-right side, the selected chat appears, featuring a text input bar, a send button, and a "+" button for additional operations, such as adding information, submitting a complaint, and other actions only for companies.

        \caption{Chat Page UI.}
        \label{fig:chat_page_UI}%
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\paragraph{Notifications page:} When the user accesses the notifications page, they are presented with a list of notifications they have received, ordered from the most recent to the least. This provides an easy way to stay up-to-date with important alerts and messages.

\begin{figure}[H]

        \caption{Notifications Page UI.}
        \label{fig:notifications_page_UI}%
    \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
\label{subsec:hardware_interfaces}%


The system will be accessible from any device equipped with an internet
browser and a stable internet connection. Users can choose their
preferred device, such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone. However, it
is recommended to use a computer for a more seamless experience when
navigating through the internship postings.


\subsection{Software interfaces}
\label{subsec:software_interfaces}%


The S\&C platform requires integration with the following software
interfaces to function effectively:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Email Provider}:\\
  The platform will utilize an eMail provider (e.g., SMTP) to send
  confirmation eMails during user registration, as well as notifications
  for internship matches, updates, and reminders.
\item
  \textbf{Notification System}:\\
  A built-in notification mechanism will deliver real-time updates to
  users within the platform (e.g., dashboard notifications for new
  applications or interview schedules).
\item
  \textbf{Data Analytics Services}:\\
  To enhance recommendations and feedback analysis, the platform may
  connect with analytics APIs or modules for data-driven insights.
\end{enumerate}

These software interfaces ensure seamless communication, efficient
notifications, and smooth external tool integration for a better user
experience.


\subsection{Communication interfaces}
\label{subsec:communication_interfaces}%


The communication interfaces required by the S\&C platform are as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{HTTPS Protocol}:\\
  The platform will use HTTPS to ensure secure communication between
  users and the system, encrypting all data exchanged to protect user
  privacy and information.
\item
  \textbf{SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)}:\\
  The platform will utilize SMTP for sending emails, including
  confirmation emails during registration, notifications about
  internship opportunities, application statuses, interview schedules,
  and other important updates to users.
\end{enumerate}

These communication interfaces are essential to ensure secure data
transmission and reliable email functionality within the system.

\section{Performance requirements}
\label{sec:performance_requirements}%


\paragraph{Number of Concurrent Users:}
  The S\&C platform must be designed to handle a significant number of
  concurrent users, ensuring smooth performance even during peak
  activity periods, such as internship application deadlines. The
  platform should support a substantial portion of its active user base
  accessing the system simultaneously.
\paragraph{Data Storage:}
  The platform must store and manage all relevant information about
  students, including CVs, profiles, and application statuses, as well
  as companies' internship postings, feedback, and selection processes.
  Historical data, such as completed internships and feedback, should
  remain accessible to support recommendations and user references.
\paragraph{Response Time:}
  Operations directly executed by the S\&C platform, such as
  registration, login, posting internships, applying for internships,
  and scheduling interviews, must have a response time of under 500
  milliseconds. For operations involving external systems, such as email
  notifications or third-party scheduling tools, the platform will
  strive to minimize delays but cannot guarantee their performance.

\section{Design constraints}
\label{sec:design_constraints}%


\subsection{Standard compliance}
\label{subsec:standard compliance}%%


The S\&C platform must comply with relevant data protection and privacy
regulations, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). This regulation ensures that the personal data of users,
including students, companies, and universities, is collected, stored,
and processed securely and transparently. The platform must implement
appropriate measures to protect user privacy and ensure data security.


\subsection{Hardware limitations}
\label{subsec:hardware_limitations}%


The primary hardware requirement for accessing the S\&C platform is a
reliable internet connection and a device with a modern web browser.


\section{Software system attributes}
\label{sec:software_system_attributes}%


\subsection{Reliability}
\label{subsec:reliability}%


The S\&C platform must be fault-tolerant to ensure continuous service
and minimize the impact of potential errors. This will prevent system
failures from propagating, allowing users to continue their tasks
without significant interruptions.


\subsection{Availability}
\label{subsec:availability}%


The S\&C platform must maintain a high level of availability. This
ensures that the platform is accessible to users at all times,
minimizing disruption to their internship search and application
processes.~


\subsection{Security}
\label{subsec:security}%


The platform must implement robust security measures to protect user
data and ensure secure access. This includes both authentication and
authorization:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Authentication will verify the identity of users attempting to log in,
  ensuring only legitimate users can access the platform.
\item
  Authorization will manage the permissions of authenticated users,
  restricting access to specific features based on user roles (e.g.,
  students, companies, or universities).
\end{itemize}

To protect sensitive information, the system will adopt best practices
for data security, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Encryption of passwords and personal data stored in the database.
\item
  Protection against query injections and other common security
  vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized data access.
\end{itemize}

These measures will ensure that the system maintains a secure
environment for users and their data.


\subsection{Maintainability}
\label{subsec:maintainability}%


The S\&C platform must be designed using scalable and modular components
to allow easy updates and additions of new features with minimal effort.
The architecture should support future expansions, such as new
functionalities or integrations with third-party services, without major
changes to the core system. Regular maintenance should be scheduled
during off-peak hours, preferably at night, to ensure minimal disruption
to users during peak traffic periods.


\subsection{Portability}
\label{subsec:portability}%


The system must be accessible to users from any device or platform that
supports a modern web browser. This ensures that students, companies,
and universities can access the platform from a variety of devices. On
the server side, there are no specific portability requirements, as the
platform will rely on standard web technologies and services to ensure
compatibility across different environments.
