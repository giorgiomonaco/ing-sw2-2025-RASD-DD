\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%

As the demand for skilled graduates grows, bridging the gap between academic learning and practical industry experience has become essential. However, students often face challenges in finding internships that align with their skills and career goals, while companies struggle to identify candidates who truly match their specific needs. Traditional job boards often fail to meet the specific needs of internships, causing mismatches and missed opportunities for students and employers.
Students and companies (S\&C) exists to address this gap by providing a tailored matchmaking platform. By aligning studentsâ€™ skills, experiences, and aspirations with detailed internship roles, S\&C ensures better fit and smoother transitions into the workforce. The platform supports proactive searches, personalized recommendations, and structured selection processes, ultimately helping students gain hands-on experience while allowing companies to find the right talent for their projects.


\subsection{Goals}
\label{subsec:goals}%

\newcounter{g}
\setcounter{g}{1}
\newcommand{\cg}{\theg\stepcounter{g}}
\textbf{[G\cg]:} University students would like to find internships that better
align with their interests and field of study.

\textbf{[G\cg]:} Companies would like to offer internships to students who best
match the related figure.

\textbf{[G\cg]:} Improve communication and coordination between students and
companies in the selection process.

\textbf{[G\cg]:} Evolve the recommendation system through feedback and
suggestions (provided by students and companies) to improve future
matches.

\textbf{[G\cg]:} Universities would like to monitor internships and handle any
emerging issues promptly, ensuring a smooth and beneficial experience
for all parties involved.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}%

In this section, we are going to identify the S\&C platform domain. There are three main users that interact with the system:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Students} -- University students seeking internships as part of their academic or career development. They can use S\&C to
  proactively browse available internships, receive customized recommendations based on their profiles, and interact with companies to begin the application and selection process.
\item
  \textbf{Companies} -- Businesses and organizations that offer internships. These companies use S\&C to advertise internship roles with detailed information on project tasks, required skills, technologies, and benefits. S\&C enables companies to receive suitable student profiles automatically, simplifying their candidate search and supporting the structured interview and selection process.
\item
  \textbf{Universities} -- Academic institutions that need to monitor and oversee their students' internship experiences. Universities use S\&C to track the status and progress of internships, address student concerns, and intervene in issues that may impact the quality of the internship.
\end{itemize}

According to the World and Machine paradigm we can identify the Machine as the System to be developed and the environment in which S\&C will be used as the World. This separation allows us to classify the entire phenomena in three different types.

\subsection{World Phenomena}
\label{subsec:world_phenomena}%

Events that take place in the real world and that the machine cannot observe:

\newcounter{w}
\setcounter{w}{1}
\newcommand{\cw}{\thew\stepcounter{w}}
\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The company creates and defines internship opportunities independently, describing tasks, required skills, and terms.

\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The student creates CVs detailing his skills and attitudes.

\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The company conducts an interview with the student.

\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The student wants to accept/reject the proposal.

\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The student or the company encounters problems during the internship and wants to report it.

\textbf{[WP\cw]:} The university handles the complaint submitted by his student or a related company.

\subsection{Machine Phenomena}
\label{subsec:machine_phenomena}%

Events that take place inside the System and cannot be observed by the
real world.

\newcounter{m}
\setcounter{m}{1}
\newcommand{\cm}{\them\stepcounter{m}}
\textbf{[MP\cm]:} The internal processes analyzes student profiles and internship postings to generate recommendations.

\textbf{[MP\cm]:} The recommendation system automatically improves using feedback and suggestions.

\subsection{Shared phenomena}
\label{subsec:shared_phenomena}%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{World controlled}
\end{itemize}

Controlled by the world and observed by the machine.

\newcounter{s}
\setcounter{s}{1}
\newcommand{\cs}{\thes\stepcounter{s}}
\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The Guest signs up to the system.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The User logs in to the system.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The C uploads internship terms and details which the system then collects.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S improves/edits his CV based on the suggestions.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The C improves/edits his internship insertion based on the suggestions.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S looks for an internship on the platform, by querying a company's name.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S reviews a C's profile.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S reviews his calendar.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S surf through the recommended internships.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S reviews an internship insertion.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S or the C submits feedback and suggestions about the matchmaking process.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S applies for an internship.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The C reviews a candidate's profile.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The C sends a contact request in order to offer an internship to a recommended student.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S accepts/refuses a contact request by a company.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The C and the S schedule an interview through the chat.

\textbf{[SP\cs]:} The S and the C finalize the selection process after the interview.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Machine controlled}
